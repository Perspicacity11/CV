## <a name="about_me">Me, myself and I</a>

Experienced media professional making a career-change into the technology space, having recently graduated from the Makers Academy software development bootcamp. My  background is in corporate communications, diversity & inclusion, commercial account management and investigative journalism.

At my core, I‚Äôm a geek for systems. I have an innate drive to systematise, optimise and structure processes to achieve high-quality outcomes. This inclination has allowed me to deliver complex, multi-stakeholder projects - from tech RFPs to corporate policy to commercial media content - at the highest level of the UK news sector. I‚Äôm driven towards the public good, and think about my work with an eye towards its impact in advancing society, making life operationally easier and safer, more inclusive and less negatively impactful.

I specialise in JavaScript - primarily across the M.E.R.N. stack - and am comfortable with TypeScript, Ruby, Tailwind CSS and testing frameworks like Cypress and Jest. My interests tend towards the backend, and I‚Äôm keen to develop my skills in data management and information security (to which end I am learning Python).
