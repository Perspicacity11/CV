## <a name="about_me">Me, myself and I</a>

Experienced media professional making a career-change into the technology space, having recently graduated from the Makers Academy software development bootcamp. My  background is in corporate communications, diversity & inclusion, commercial account management and investigative journalism.

At my core, I’m a geek for systems. I can't abide inefficiency and have an innate drive to systematise, optimise and structure processes in my work to achieve high-quality outcomes; to be less powerpoint about it, I like to make things run better. This inclination has allowed me to deliver complex, multi-stakeholder projects - from tech RFPs to corporate policy to commercial media content - at the highest level of the UK news sector. I’m driven towards the public good, and think about my work with an eye towards its impact in advancing society, making life operationally easier and safer, more inclusive and less harmful to the planet.

I am most comfortable in JavaScript - primarily across the M.E.R.N. stack - and am also versed in TypeScript, Ruby, CSS, HTML, and testing frameworks like Cypress and Jest. To extend those skills I recently completed a 14-course IBM certification in DevOps and software engineering, and am undertaking the AWS Cloud Solutions Architect professional cerficiation at associate level. My ideal role would involve working full-stack across the whole development lifecycle, and I’m especially keen to develop my skills in data analysis, information security and applied AI.

## <a name="interests">My interests</a>

**Diversity, equity and inclusion**

When I'm not coding I'm usually involved in corporate and creative DEI advocacy in my capacity as Co-Director of Advocacy at Outvertising. I am also an independent consultant specialising in LGBTQ+ workplace inclusivity, and work that I led has been shortlisted at the British LGBT Awards, the Rainbow Honours and the British Diversity Awards. My work in this space has led me to mentor young LGTBQ+ professionals and students, to speak at conferences and deliver workshops to organisations of all shapes and sizes.

**Gaming**

And when I'm not doing either of those, I'm usually playing grand stategy games like Europa Universalis, Stellaris, CK3 or Total War. Otherwise I'm an Xbox loyalist, and you can find me playing RPGs! I needed a hobby that allowed me to escape the entrapment stress of lockdown and it's since been remarkably therapeutic. I've even made some friends courtesy of the folks at Gaymers Inc!

**Current affairs**

I consider myself a lifelong politics student, and maintain a close interest in the political, economic and geostrategic affairs of the UK, US, China and the EU. I can reliably be spotted in a bar having a 'spirited' discussion about the use of QMV in the European Council, cannabis legalisation, HS2 or some other admittedly bureaucratic topic. I am, avowedly, a dork.
